### 👋  Hi my name is Jamon Dixon and I am a Full-stack Software Engineer.  After feeling unfufilled in my previous career path, I have decided to switch gears and follow a new path into technology. I'd love to make use of my ability to learn fast and adapt to my surroundings, while making a difference in people's lives.  My goal is to create beautifully useful applications for people from all walks of life and have fun while I do it! 👋
