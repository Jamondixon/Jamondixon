### 👋  Hi my name is Jamon Dixon and I am a Full-stack Software Engineer.  After several unfufilling years in the cannabis industry I have decided to switch gears and follow a new path into technology. My goal is to create beautifully useful applications for people from all walks of life, and have fun while I do it! 👋
